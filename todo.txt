1. Add docstrings to classes and functions:

2. Improve variable naming:
Some variable names could be more descriptive. 

3. Add comments for complex logic:
In areas where the logic is complex, add inline comments to explain what's happening. 

4. Update README.md:
Ensure the README.md file is up-to-date with the new GitHub analysis feature and provides clear instructions for users:

5. Consider creating a CONTRIBUTING.md file:
This file can provide guidelines for contributors, explaining coding standards, how to set up the development environment, and the process for submitting pull requests.

6. Add type hints consistently:
Ensure all function parameters and return values have type hints for better code understanding and IDE support.

7. Consider breaking down large methods:
If any methods are particularly long or complex, consider breaking them into smaller, more focused methods. This can improve readability and maintainability.
